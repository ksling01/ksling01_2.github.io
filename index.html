<p>Engineering Projects
<ul> 
  <li>Swarm Robot <br>EE31 Junior Design</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Constructed and designed an autonomous swarm robot that communicated with one other robot to detect sites of chemical toxicity (imitated by colors instead due to potential hazards)</li>
      <li>	Made use of an ARDUINO board, H-Bridge, Light Sensors, LED's, Infra-Red Communication, collision detection mechanism, and an electro-mechanical drive system to accomplish the task.</li>

    </ul>
  <li>Digital Counter <br>ES4 Digital Design</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a timer that counts down to zero from a specified number and upon reaching zero uses a speaker to play sound frequencies corresponding to specific clock pulses.</li>
      <li>Used combinational logic circuits and programmed an EPROM to solve the problem.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Song Search Engine <br>Comp15 Data Structures </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Created a search engine for a large database of songs and their lyrics.</li>
      <li>A Specific word was typed and the top ten songs that contain that word were given to the user.</li>
      <li>Implemented various C++ data structures and algorithms to create a program that would run quickly and effectively with large amounts of data.</li>
